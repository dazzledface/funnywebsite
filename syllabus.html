                 <h3>Course format re: COVID-19</h3>

               <p>The University has shifted back to fully in-person instruction for all classes designated as such in
                  Connect Carolina, so until further notice, all our class meetings will take place in person. Lectures
                  will be recorded and made available to you, but for now regular Zoom/remote attendance will not be
                  offered. Attendance will not be taken at in-person lectures, but I suggest you do attend class,
                  especially if you are a beginner.</p>

               <p>That said: we are simply going to have to play this semester by ear. It’s possible we’ll decide to
                  shift some of our meetings to Zoom-only or asynchronous formats as we go along. Any such changes will
                  be posted on Sakai and emailed to your UNC email addresses. </p>

               <p>Masks are currently not required by the University, so they are not required in this classroom. Of
                  course, you are more than welcome to wear one. If University policy changes, we’ll adjust accordingly.
                  Please feel free to reach out with any concerns.</p>

               <p>I reserve the right to adjust or change this plan as the COVID situation evolves, and I thank you in
                  advance for your patience during what may be a complicated semester. Although many of our
                  circumstances are beyond my control, I commit to working with you to help make your experience in this
                  class positive, useful, and—most importantly—safe.
               </p>

               <br>

               <h3>Target audience</h3>

               <p>This introductory course is accessible to all students from all backgrounds. Aspiring web developers,
                  entrepreneurs, visual artists, librarians, humanists (digital and non), programmers, performers,
                  poets, hobbyists, scientists, educators, and others are all equally valued and welcome. No prior
                  technical expertise or programming experience is assumed, required, or necessary.</p>

               <p>Here's what this course covers: the fundamentals of modern HTML5 and CSS3; responsive web design; web
                  accessibility standards; usability and user interface (UI) design; and a very gentle, very basic
                  introduction to JavaScript, libraries, and a couple of front-end CSS/JS frameworks.</p>

               <p>Here's what this course does not cover: much web programming proper (HTML and CSS are not technically
                  "programming languages"); databases; dynamic web app development; APIs; full-stack web dev frameworks.
                  Experienced programmers and developers please note: these tools and methods are crucial to modern web
                  development in the field, but this is a fundamentals course--so although we'll discuss them, their use
                  is beyond the scope of this class.</p>

               <br>

               <h3>Goals & objectives</h3>

               <p>The primary goal of this course is to help students become competent advanced-beginner- to
                  intermediate-level web designers, independent learners, and capable problem solvers through a
                  project-based
                  approach to responsive web and UI design and development and its associated troubleshooting
                  strategies.
                  To
                  this end, our primary objectives and planned learning outcomes are as follows.</p>


               <p> By the end of this course, students will:</p>

               <ul class="list">
                  <li class="list-item">Possess an understanding of the basic and necessary processes and skills
                     involved
                     in front-end responsive
                     web design and development;</li>
                  <li class="list-item">Possess a working HTML5 and CSS3 skillset;</li>
                  <li class="list-item">Understand and be able to employ modern UI design principles;</li>
                  <li class="list-item">Possess the knowledge necessary to effectively pursue further formal or
                     self-motivated education in more
                     advanced web development tools and skills;</li>
                  <li class="list-item">Have developed a well-designed, well-functioning live web site suitable for
                     inclusion in, or as, a
                     professional, artistic, and/or academic portfolio.</li>
               </ul>




                 <h3>Grading</h3>

               <p> Assignments: 20%</p>
               <p> Quizzes: 20%</p>
               <p> Final project: 20%</p>
               <p> Midterm: 20%</p>
               <p> Final exam: 20%</p>
               <p> Final grades will be converted to letter grades according to the following scale: A: 94-100; A-:
                  90-93; B+: 87-89; B: 84-86; B-: 80-83; C+: 77-79; and so on. I do round up, but only and strictly at
                  0.51.</p>

                <h3>Software & tools</h3>

               <p>I recommend a lovely free text editor called Visual Studio Code and
                  will
                  demo its setup for the benefit of beginners; more on that here:
                  <a href="setup.html" target="_blank">Text Editor Setup</a>. But you're welcome to use the editor of
                  your choice.</p>


               <p>Codepen account. I’ll use Codepen for simple in-class demos and to share examples. Please create a
                  free
                  account at <a href="https://codepen.io/">https://codepen.io/</a>, if you don’t already have
                  one, and find and follow my account there
                  Search
                  for me by user: username tkjn.</p>


                 <h3>Final project</h3>

               <p>In the COMP 126 final project, you'll form teams of 2-4 people and operate as a web design and
                  development
                  team hired to build a site for a client. I encourage you to find a “real” client for a “real” project
                  among
                  yourselves or in the community: an individual, group, club, company, whatever. The important thing is
                  to
                  have a way to define a client’s needs, goals, and priorities for the design and build of the site; why
                  not
                  offer your web development services to a group in need?</p>
               <br>
               <h3>Quizzes, homework, & exams</h3>

               <p>Unless specified otherwise, assignments will be scored on a 1-10 scale according to a rubric that will
                  be provided for each. Quizzes, exams, and the final project will be scored between 0 and 100. I
                  generally do not need to apply curves to exam scores, and I do not drop a lowest quiz score. I also do
                  not offer extra credit assignments: what you see is what you get.</p>

                  <p>Quizzes will usually comprise 10 multiple-choice questions and be delivered on Sakai with a 30-minute
                     time limit, open book, open notes, open everything. (The professor reserves the right to alter this
                     format; notice will be given of any changes.) Quiz make-ups will be granted when accompanied by a
                     University Excused Absence or when arranged and approved by the professor at least 24 hours in
                     advance. We do not drop a lowest quiz score.</p>

               <p>The midterm exam will be half multiple-choice, half a coding exercise in which you'll be given an
                  image of a website layout you must re-create using HTML and CSS according to a set of given
                  parameters. Rescheduling
                  or making up the midterm requires a University Excused Absence. </p>

               <p>The final exam will be multiple-choice only, since your final project—a fully developed, live
                  website—is due at the same time and covers the coding aspect. It will be administered in compliance
                  with UNC's final exam regulations and scheduled according to the UNC Final Exam calendar. Rescheduling
                  or making up a final exam requires an exam excuse letter from the University. No exceptions.</p>

      

               <br>
               <h3>Late assignments, extensions, & resubmission</h3>

               <p>Regular assignments (that is, non-exam- or final-project-related) assignments will be accepted for
                  credit only if submitted within two weeks after each assignment's original
                  due date. Late submissions during this two-week window will be penalized about -0.143 of a point per
                  day (or portion of a day), with a total max deduction of 2/10 points. After that two-week window has
                  passed, late submissions for that assignment will no longer be accepted. Note that this only applies
                  until LDOC; after LDOC, no late assignments will be accepted, regardless of how long it's been since
                  the original due date. This is necessary to ensure we have enough time to grade all your work prior to
                  our final exam date.</p>

               <p>If you earn less than a 7 on a regular assignment--that is, a 6.9 or lower--you have the option to
                  redo and resubmit it for regrading--<b>if</b> you can get it in within the late submission window
                  described above (two weeks after
                  the due date, up until LDOC). The resubmission will be treated as a late assignment and will incur
                  late penalties on the schedule described above (-0.143 per day late), but if your original submission
                  was very poor, it might be worth it.</p>

               <p>The final project is due on our final exam date. Therefore, no late final projects will be accepted.
               </p>

               <p>Requests for reasonable extensions will be considered when requested in advance—preferably 24, but at
                  least 12, hours before the assignment is due. </p>



               <p>Please see the previous section for quiz and exam rescheduling and make-up policies.</p>
               <br>

               <br>
               <h3>Diversity, community, & support</h3>

               <p>Each one of you—regardless of background, origin, race, ethnicity, nationality,
                  religion,
                  sexual orientation, gender identification, class, age, learning style, appearance, physical ability,
                  0r
                  anything else—deserves the opportunity to join a learning environment that is warm, respectful, and
                  welcoming of a diversity of voices and perspectives. I am committed to doing everything I can to
                  foster
                  such
                  an environment, which I consider my duty to you and our community, as well as my professional
                  obligation.
                  I
                  hope you will all work with me to accomplish this, and I welcome any suggestions you might have.</p>

               <p>Please read on for details about University resources and policies that support this commitment to
                  diversity
                  and inclusion.</p>
               <br>
               <h3>Policy on non-discrimination</h3>

               <p> The University is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for all members of
                  our
                  community and to ensuring that educational and employment decisions are based on individuals’
                  abilities
                  and
                  qualifications. Consistent with this principle and applicable laws, the University’s Policy Statement
                  on
                  Non-Discrimination offers access to its educational programs and activities as well as employment
                  terms
                  and
                  conditions without respect to race, color, gender, national origin, age, religion, creed, genetic
                  information, disability, veteran’s status, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. 
                  Such a
                  policy ensures that only relevant factors are considered and that equitable and consistent standards
                  of
                  conduct and performance are applied.</p>
               <p>
                  If you are experiencing harassment or discrimination, you can seek assistance and file a report

               <h3>Accessibility Resources & Services</h3>
               <p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill facilitates the implementation of reasonable
                  accommodations,
                  including resources and services, for students with disabilities, chronic medical conditions, a
                  temporary
                  disability or pregnancy complications resulting in barriers to fully accessing University courses,
                  programs
                  and activities.</p>

               <p>Accommodations are determined through the Office of Accessibility Resources and Service (ARS) for
                  individuals with documented qualifying disabilities in accordance with applicable state and federal
                  laws.
                  See the ARS Website for contact information: <a href="https://ars.unc.edu">https://ars.unc.edu</a> or
                  email <a href="mailto:ars.unc.edu">ars@unc.edu.</a></p>

               <p>If you require any special accommodations to complete the work in this course, please make sure the
                  appropriate campus entity makes me aware of your needs. You are welcome to discuss the specifics with
                  me
                  but
                  absolutely not required to do so. I take your privacy and personal integrity seriously, in this area
                  and
                  all
                  others.</p>

               <h3>Counseling & Psychological Services</h3>

               <p>CAPS is strongly committed to addressing the mental health needs of a diverse student body through
                  timely
                  access to consultation and connection to clinically appropriate services, whether for short or
                  long-term
                  needs. Visit their website at <a href="https://caps.unc.edu/">https://caps.unc.edu/</a> or stop by
                  their facilities on the third floor of the
                  Campus Health Services building for a walk-in evaluation to learn more.</p>

              <h3 id="honor-code">Honor code</h3>
               

               <p>Every time you turn in an assignment at this University, you implicitly agree—whether or not you sign
                  anything—that you have neither given nor received unauthorized aid, that the work you present is your
                  own,
                  and that you’ve properly cited and attributed all source materials.</p>


               <p>Plagiarism is an especially serious breach of UNC’s Honor Code and of your own intellectual and
                  personal
                  integrity. It includes any use of another’s words, ideas, or research—whether quoted, paraphrased, or
                  mentioned—without proper and full citation and attribution. This applies to materials taken from any
                  source,
                  online or off, including code.</p>

               <p>Note that assignment/exam submissions containing code fully or primarily authored by someone else will
                  also
                  be considered plagiarism, even if that code was offered freely by its author for use and re-use, and
                  even
                  if
                  you cite your source. The code you write in this class must be primarily your own original work. A
                  more detailed description of how much and what kind of code you’re permitted to borrow and use in your
                  assignments in this class (and why) is <a href="borrowing.html">available here</a>.</p>


               <p>Please also note that although collaboration with other COMP 126 students may be permitted on certain
                  assignments, it is absolutely prohibited on any aspect of any quiz or exam.</p>


               <p>If you do not understand the definitions of plagiarism, citation, attribution, or “unauthorized aid”,
                  it
                  is
                  your responsibility to remedy that; ignorance will not be accepted as an excuse. UNC Libraries'
                  plagiarism
                  tutorial is a good place to start: <a

               </p>
               <p>Please feel free to
                  contact
                  me with any questions or for additional clarification.</p>

               <p>Because it is neither my responsibility nor my place to determine whether breaches of the Honor Code
                  are
                  intentional or unintentional, I will immediately report all suspected violations to the Honor Court,
                  which
                  may result in a failing grade, probation, suspension, or expulsion.</p>
               <br>

               <h3>Disclaimer</h3>

               <p>I reserve the right to make changes to the syllabus and schedule of this course. I'll announce any
                  changes
