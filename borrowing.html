               <h3>This is important; please read it.</h3>

               <p>In this class, you’ll learn to use front-end frameworks and libraries to enhance your designs. You’ll
                  also be encouraged to
                  look up, borrow, play with, modify, and reuse discrete, limited chunks of other developers’ code into
                  your projects and labs, as long as those materials are offered freely for use and reuse by their
                  authors. (If someone posts code on a public blog or website or in a public repository on a
                  code-sharing site like Codepen or GitHub, it’s safe to assume that it’s freely offered.)
               </p>

               <p>However, <b>you must write the majority of the code in all your assignments and projects yourself,
                     individually (in the case of labs) or as a collaborative original effort along with your group
                     members (this applies to the final project only).</b> This means that a) the overall
                  framework/layout of each of your sites and submissions must always be your own original work; and b)
                  when you borrow something from an example you find online or in a textbook, you must apply sufficient
                  modification, customization, and original effort to integrate the borrowed code into your overall
                  submission. You must understand and be able to control the way all the code you use works. If you
                  submit an assignment containing methods that we haven’t learned about in class, you may be asked to
                  demonstrate that you understand and can control those methods. <b>If you aren’t able to demonstrate
                     this, you will automatically receive a 0 for the assignment–and if we’re able to find the code you
                     borrowed online or other proof of plagiarism/sharing/copying, it’ll also be turned over to the
                     Honor Court.</b></p>

               <p><b>You may not download a fully functional web page or template and turn it in as your own, even if
                     you tweak a few things. You may not take code written by someone else and turn it in as your own,
                     even if you tweak a few things. Such actions will be considered full-on plagiarism and turned over
                     to the Honor Court.</b> This is not as hard to catch as you might think. We’re familiar with the
                  usual red flags, and various code-matching resources make it easy to check.</p>


               <p><b>As for textual and other non-code content: all of the text and other content on your site must be
                     a) your own or your client’s original writing, or b) clearly quoted, cited, and attributed to its
                     original author, directly on the site. </b>This remains true even if the author of the content has
                  freely shared it for use and reuse. This is because copyright infringement isn’t really the issue
                  here; it’s about plagiarism.</p>

               <p><b>In an educational framework, the use of content created by others without clear citation and
                     attribution is plagiarism, no matter what the medium: the same standards apply to code as to
                     research papers, exam answers, creative projects, and pretty much everything else.</b> You may
                  borrow methods and components, but you must understand whatever you borrow enough to customize and
                  integrate it into your own work, and the overall frameworks of your projects must be entirely your
                  own.</p>


               <p><b>If you’re unclear about the definition and/or practice of plagiarism in this class or elsewhere, it
                     is your responsibility to remedy that before you make a mistake that could have long-term
                     effects.</b></p>
